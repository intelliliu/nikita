hello nikita!
  protocol buffer is one of the most fast and thin serialize framework in the internet world

  however the example on the developer.google.com is not friendly to java developer,as its use 
is very rely on bussiness() code and very unconvenient

  so there is one sentence that "java problem java done",thanks to the java reflect package(J.L.R),
we could easily describle a java object by itself instead of the fucking *.proto file,and then convert 
it to Messager Format which accord with the PB standard,and the process of process is the same way...
